# Firecrawl Lead Gen

Use this to extract legitimately accessible prospect lists.

## Onboarding Interview

Infer the prospect target, source, lead count, and output format from context. If the target is clear, proceed immediately.

Ask at most 1-3 concise questions only if blocked, such as the prospect definition, source/auth requirement, or target lead count.

## Firecrawl Collection Plan

Use Firecrawl browser for databases requiring filters, search forms, pagination, or login. Use search/scrape for public sources.

Apply filters such as role, company size, industry, geography, funding stage, and technologies when available.

## Extraction Fields

Capture visible or legitimately accessible fields:

- name
- title
- company
- company URL
- location
- email, phone, and LinkedIn only when visible/allowed
- industry, company size, funding stage
- notes and profile URL

## Final Deliverable

```markdown
# Lead List: [Target]

## Summary
[Source, filters, count, caveats]

## Leads
[Table or link to JSON/CSV]

## Data Gaps
[Masked, unavailable, or paywalled fields]

## Rerun Inputs
workflow: firecrawl-lead-gen
target: [description]
source: [auto/source/url]
max_leads: [number]
output: [json/csv/markdown]
```

## Quality Bar

- Only extract publicly visible or legitimately accessible data.
- Note masked, unavailable, or paywalled fields.
- Deduplicate leads.
- Do not bypass CAPTCHAs or access controls.
